Spotify to MP3 using API and URI

SpotyDownloader uses youtube-dl, ffmpeg and spotipy to download all your favorite songs

this program allows you to download all the songs in a playlist. to make this program work best, it's best to run it from the terminal, rather than opening it directly. 
to get everything you need, just do SpotyDownloader.exe --help. 
there it explains everything there is to do to get the required data.
