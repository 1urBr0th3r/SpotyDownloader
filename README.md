# HOW TO USE

To use it, you simply download the zip file (SpotyDownloaderExe.zip) and unpack it. Then you just open the SpotyDownloader.exe file inside of it, and you are good to go! Simply put username, password and playlist's name when asked. You just need to trust this program (bc it is been downloaded just a few times so windows still doesnt recognize it as safe to use, but trust me, it is safe). Just keep the file, allow to connect to net and spotify when asked.

Then it will automatically run on CMD a pseudo-python program, which controls all downloaded songs in the chosen directory, and also automatically corrects errors that could occur while downloading.

Have a nice try! Bye!

P. S. If you are a full noob on how to download from GitHub, there is a tab on the right of your screen with "Releases". Just download the latest release by clicking on it and pressing on "Source code.zip", OR just press "Code" and then "Download ZIP", but then you download all the branch's files, OR you just click on the SpotyDownloader.zip file, then you press that button on top-right of your screen, which has 3 dots, and then you just press "Download".
